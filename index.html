Alright, enough talk. Letâ€™s (finally) start chain ruling. By using chain rule, we find that 

$$ \delta^l_j = \frac{\partial C}{\partial z^l_j} = \delta^l_j = \frac{\partial C}{\partial z^l_j} = \sum_k \frac{\partial C}{\partial a^l_k} \frac{\partial a^l_k}{\partial z^l_j} $$

We can apply the multivariate chain rule because \( C \) is a function of \( (a^l_1, a^l_2, \dots, a^l_m) \), and each \( a^l_i \) is in turn a function of \( (z^l_1, z^l_2, \dots, z^l_m) \). Actually, each \( a^l_i \) is a function of just \( z^l_i \). Namely \( a^l_i = \sigma ( z^l_i ) \).
